WEEK 1

Today in our IT lesson we looked at our githubs again. We went back through basics like changing our avatar. We also looked at our description and updated our one from jekyll to jekyll-now. This updated in and we deleted all our old posts. We went through things that we did last year. So basically this was a recap lesson.
