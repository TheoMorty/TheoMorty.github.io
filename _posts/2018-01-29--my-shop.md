Now I have finished organising my shop it is time for the final outcome.

My stock market is very unlikely and far fetched but I think that a sweatshop could probably get you good profit.

MY tax and employee money is also in this shop and it comes up with my wage with simple calculation by minusing total cost+tax from my profit and it comes up with how much im making.

Then my till from day 1 with data validation and vlookup. It comes up with a sale as well as how much you need to buy for the sale as well as original price.
