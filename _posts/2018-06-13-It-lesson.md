In today's lesson we talked about binary,denary and hex. This was a recap lesson as well as figuring out easy ways to define numbers with 1 at the end of binary it needs to be odd. As well as that we learnt tricks with hex as the second part of binary up to the first 16 is the second number of hex and the first part from 1 to 8 would be the first number. This can make easy calculations as they are some good tricks. As well as this in binary a easy way t figure out a number is to go a step ahead and then work backwards.
