In todays lesson we used repl.it which is a coding website. It was a very challenging lesson as we had to draw 3 Ts. One 1D, one 2D and one 3D. In lesson before we had to draw are initials so I already had The 1D T. Now for the 2D T you had to think of it or draw it on some paper to get a really good idea of it. This was a challenging task especially when we had to fill in the shape but we managed. For the 3D T i copy and pasted the 2D  T and near enough copied the shape again without fill and changing some angles. Many times I had to be very precise with most of my coding having ended in a 3 but overall I think that it was a very good lesson and challenged us.
