This week I organized my shop. I've made my stock with potential profit on a total different sheet. Mean while this messed up my data validation so I did it again whilst on the new sheet so it worked. This new sheet made me also use everything to take into account. For example how much I bought for the items how much they sell and how many I sell. We talked about if nothing of one sort off item doesn't sell then we put in on sale. 

This is my shop right now in all this coding all you need is simple adding equations.
